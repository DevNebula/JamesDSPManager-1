To create your own unity/audmodlib mod, all of the files you need to modify are located in the common folder of this zip
NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE A BLANK LINE AT THE END OF EACH FILE
Instructions are contained in each file

1. Add your mod info to module.prop
2. Place your files in their respective directories in the system folder (where they will be installed to)
2a. For apps, place in system/app/APPNAME/APPNAME.apk
3. Place any files that need conditionals (only installed in some circumstances) in the custom folder (can be placed however you want)
4. Add your min android version and other variables to common/unity-uservariables.sh (more instructions are in the file)
4a. Note the Audmodlib variable in this file. Uncomment it if you're making an audio module
5. Add any scripts you want run at boot (late service start in magisk) to common/unity-scripts.sh
6. Modify the post-fs-data.sh in common as you would with any other magisk module
6a. If post-fs-data is going to be used, set their values to true in config.sh (THESE WILL BE INSTALLED AS REGULAR BOOT SCRIPTS IF NOT A MAGISK INSTALL)
7. Add any build props you want added into the unity-props.prop
8. Add any build props you want removed into the unity-props-remove.prop
9. Add any possibly conflicting files you want removed/wiped before install into the unity-file-wipe.sh
10. Add any config/policy/mixer patches you want added into the aml-patches.sh (audio module only)
11. Add the removal of your patches into the aml-patches-remove.sh (audio module only)
12. Add any other config/policy/mixer patches you want removed before install into the aml-patches-wipe.sh (audio module only)
13. Add any custom permissions needed into config.sh (this will apply to both magisk and system installs) (default permissions is 755 for folders and 644 for files)
14. Add any custom install/uninstall logic to unity-customrules1.sh (follow the instructions inside)
14a. This is where you would put your stuff for any custom files and whatever else isn't taken care of already

*NOTE FOR PATCHING: patches need to be put into both system/etc/audio_effects (CONFIG_FILE) and /vendor/etc/audio_effects (V_CONFIG_FILE)

SYSTEM AND VENDOR VARIABLES

SYS -> location of system folder
VEN -> location of vendor folder

**$SYS and $VEN are dynamic variables for system and vendor depending on device
OTHER DYNAMIC VARIABLES

INFO -> (System installs only) corresponds to a file that will save the list of installed files and is how aml knows what needs removed during uninstall
INSTALLER -> Location of installer files (needed for customrules only)
MODID -> The name of your mod - you set this in the config.sh
MK_PRFX -> Contains the proper mkdir command regardless of install method. Always use this instead of a manual mkdir command
MK_SFFX -> Contains proper permissions for mkdir command regardless of install method. Always put this at end of any mkdir command
CP_PRFX -> Contains the proper copy command regardless of install method. Always use this instead of a manual cp command
CP_SFFX -> Contains proper permissions for cp command regardless of install method. Always put this at end of any cp command
RM_PRFX -> Contains the proper rm command for files regardless of install method. Always use this instead of a manual rm command
RMFOL_PRFX -> Contains the proper rm command for folders regardless of install method. Always use this instead of a manual rm -r command
RMFOL_SFFX -> Contains proper suffix (.replace for magisk installs) for rm -r command regardless of install method. Always put this at end of any rm -r command
UNITY -> Conatins proper location for mod regardless of install method (MODPATH for magisk installs)
AMLPATH -> The destination path to aml files (see the AUDMODLIB variables above)
MAGISK -> true if magisk install, false otherwise. Useful for unity-scripts if you want parts to only run with/without magisk installs
SH -> the directory in which the script is running. Only applicable to unity-scripts
EXT -> the extension for script files in $SH. Only applicable to unity-scripts

**These are set dynamically based on device some examples of use:
$CP_PRFX $INSTALLER/system/lib/example.so $UNITY$SYS/lib/example.so$CP_SFFX
$MK_SFFX $UNITY$SYS/lib/example.so$MK_SFFX

*NOTE ABOUT THE INFO VARIABLE:
Any files you copy over in a customrule needs to be echoed to the INFO file in that rule as well in the if statement in order for uninstallation to proceed correctly.
See instructions in the customrules files for reference
Example: echo "$UNITY$SYS/lib/soundfx/libv4a_fx_ics.so" >> $INFO

USABLE FUNCTIONS (in customrules)
custom_app_install: Will install the specified custom app into the proper directory (Ex: custom_app_install ViPER4AndroidFX).
*NOTE ABOUT CUSTOM APPS:
You probably won't need to use custom apps. This is only for apps that are only installed with specific conditions
Have the app placed in the installer in this pattern: /custom/appname/appname.apk (Ex: /custom/ViPER4AndroidFX/ViPER4AndroidFX.apk)

MAIN AUDMODLIB FUNCTIONS

unity_prop_remove: removes all props in specified file from a common aml prop file. Example usage: unity_prop_remove $INSTALLER/common/props.prop
unity_prop_copy: adds all props in specified file to a common aml prop file. Example usage: unity_prop_copy $INSTALLER/common/props.prop
unity_mod_wipe: removes all specified folders/files/patches that may conflict with install.
unity_mod_directory: creates directories (folders) for files to be installed
unity_mod_copy: copies/installs the files
aml_mod_patch: patches specificed config/policy/mixer files and enables all config/policy/mixer files to be shared between all aml mods
unity_uninstall: uninstalls mod (removes applicable files/folders/patches). The uninstallation process is handled automatically so you probably won't need to call this function.

TIMEOFEXEC VALUES - when the customrules file will execute in the (un)installer script

0=File will not be run (default)
1=unity_mod_wipe
2=unity_mod_directory
3=unity_mod_copy
4=aml_mod_patch
5=unity_uninstall

*HINT: If you have props you want set under certain conditions, have that customrule's TIMEOFEXEC=3. Example: unity_prop_copy $INSTALLER/common/props.prop
If you have props you want removed under certain conditions, have that customrule's TIMEOFEXEC=1. Example: unity_prop_remove $INSTALLER/common/props.prop
